non persisting travel wish list


buttons are currently decoration only

I like the feature of adding the new destination below the first as though a 'photo strip' 
  - however the intention is for it be a 'new' card, as is it is a continuation / expansion of the original card. 
  
Future 
- integrate API for destination reviews 
- backend database for persistance 
- add to portfolio

if for no other reason "Do it for the process." LK
